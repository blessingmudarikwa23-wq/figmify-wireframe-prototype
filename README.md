# Figmify: From Wireframe to Prototype

This project showcases my practical understanding of transforming **low-fidelity wireframes** into **high-fidelity Figma prototypes**.  
It reflects how I apply wireframing techniques to enhance user experience, improve collaboration, and ensure efficient design before development starts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to move from early design concepts to fully structured, interactive prototypes using **Figma**.  
Through this project, I:

- Designed and refined interface layouts.
- Identified usability issues early through wireframing.
- Practiced how to communicate design intent clearly before coding.
- Improved my understanding of user-centered design and documentation.
