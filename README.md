# Figmify: From Wireframe to Prototype

This project showcases my practical understanding of transforming **low-fidelity wireframes** into **high-fidelity Figma prototypes**.  
It reflects how I apply wireframing techniques to enhance user experience, improve collaboration, and ensure efficient design before development starts.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to move from early design concepts to fully structured, interactive prototypes using **Figma**.  
Through this project, I:

- Designed and refined interface layouts.
- Identified usability issues early through wireframing.
- Practiced how to communicate design intent clearly before coding.
- Improved my understanding of user-centered design and documentation.

## 🪄 What I Learned

Working on this project helped me to:
1. Understand how **wireframes** shape the foundation of good UI/UX design.  
2. Recognize the difference between **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity** wireframes.  
3. Use **Figma** effectively for building realistic prototypes.  
4. Organize project documentation and images neatly using **GitHub**.  
5. See how visual planning can make the software development process smoother and more efficient.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used
- **Figma** – for designing wireframes and prototypes  
- **GitHub** – for version control and project management  
- **Markdown (README.md)** – for writing structured documentation

## 📸 My Workflow

Here’s how I approached the project:
1. Started by sketching out low-fidelity wireframes (basic layout ideas).  
2. Used **Figma** to build the high-fidelity wireframes.  
3. Exported PNGs or `.fig` files to my folders.  
4. Wrote down usability notes and design reflections in the `docs/` folder.  
5. Uploaded everything to GitHub for review and feedback.

## 💡 Key Insight

I learned that **wireframing is one of the most powerful tools in UI/UX design**.  
It helps save time, improve communication, and prevent major usability problems later in development.
