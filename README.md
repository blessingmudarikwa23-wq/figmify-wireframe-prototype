# Figmify: From Wireframe to Prototype

**Repository:** `wireframing`  
**Project summary:**  
This project teaches the wireframing process from low-fidelity sketches to high-fidelity interactive prototypes using Figma. It explains key wireframe elements, compares wireframe types, highlights Figma’s strengths, and presents a real-world example showing how wireframing prevented usability issues before development.

## Introduction to Wireframing
**What is wireframing?**  
A wireframe is a simple visual guide that represents a product’s layout and structure. It uses boxes, lines, and text placeholders to show where elements (headers, navigation, images, buttons, forms) will appear on a screen. Wireframes focus on layout, hierarchy, and functionality rather than visual polish.

**Why wireframing matters**  
- Helps teams visualize structure before design or code is written.  
- Reveals usability problems early at low cost.  
- Improves communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- Speeds up iteration by allowing quick changes to flow and layout.

## Key Elements of Wireframes
Below are the core elements you should include in any wireframe, with short explanations and examples.

### 1. Layout Structure
**What it is:** The arrangement of major page areas (header, footer, sidebars, content blocks).  
**Why it matters:** It defines the visual hierarchy and helps users focus on the most important tasks.  
**Example:** A landing page layout with a top navigation, a hero section (large banner), a three-column features section, and a footer.

### 2. Navigation
**What it is:** Menus, tabs, breadcrumbs, and the primary way users move through the product.  
**Why it matters:** Clear navigation minimizes confusion and improves task completion rates.  
**Example:** A top navigation bar with “Home | Explore | Bookings | Profile” and a visible search input.

### 3. Content Placement
**What it is:** Where headings, paragraphs, images, and calls-to-action (CTAs) are placed.  
**Why it matters:** Proper placement prioritizes essential content and clarifies user paths.  
**Example:** Placing the main CTA (“Book Now”) near the top-right in the hero area so it’s easy to find.

### 4. Functionality (Interaction Notes)
**What it is:** Descriptions of how elements behave (what happens when clicked, error states, form validation).  
**Why it matters:** Ensures developers and stakeholders understand expected behavior before implementation.  
**Example:** “Clicking ‘Cancel Booking’ opens a confirmation modal with ‘Confirm’ and ‘Close’ options.”

## Types of Wireframes
### Low-Fidelity Wireframes (Lo-fi)
**Description:** Simple sketches or grayscale frames using boxes and placeholder text.  
**Use cases:** Early-stage concepting, fast iteration, validating layout and flow with stakeholders or users.  
**When to use:** At the start of the project when you want quick feedback about structure and navigation.

**Lo-fi example indicators:** Hand-drawn sketches, simple rectangles labeled “Image” or “Text”, no color or real images.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes (Hi-fi)
**Description:** More detailed wireframes with accurate spacing, typography, images, colors, and near-final visuals.  
**Use cases:** Usability testing, handing off to developers, finalizing interaction details.  
**When to use:** After lo-fi has validated the structure and the team needs realistic prototypes for testing.

**Hi-fi example indicators:** Real fonts, precise spacing, detailed icons, real images, and interactive flows in a tool like Figma.

## Wireframing Tools (Focus on Figma)
### Popular tools overview
- **Figma** — Cloud-based, collaborative, strong for both wireframes and prototypes.  
- **Sketch** — Mac-only, strong design tooling (less collaboration by default).  
- **Adobe XD** — Similar to Figma, integrates well with Adobe ecosystem.  
- **Balsamiq** — Purpose-built for rapid lo-fi wireframing (sketchy style).  
- **Pen & Paper** — Great for the very first ideas and quick team sketching.

### Why Figma is recommended
- **Real-time collaboration:** Multiple people can edit and comment simultaneously.  
- **Cloud storage & sharing:** Easy to share prototypes with reviewers via link.  
- **Components & variants:** Build reusable UI pieces (buttons, cards) to maintain consistency.  
- **Prototyping features:** Link frames, add interactions, and preview clickable flows without code.  
- **Plugins & assets:** Import images, generate placeholder content, and export optimized assets for the web.

## Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development
1. **Reduced rework and cost:** Catching layout and flow issues before development avoids expensive changes later.  
2. **Improved communication:** Wireframes create a visual language everyone (stakeholders, developers, testers) can understand.  
3. **Faster iteration:** Changing a sketch or frame is quicker than rewriting front-end code.  
4. **Better usability outcomes:** Early user testing on wireframes reveals confusing flows and missing information.  
5. **Clarified requirements:** Provides developers with clear behavior expectations, reducing ambiguity in implementation.

**Example benefit scenario:** A complex booking flow that appears simple in text can reveal hidden steps when drawn; wireframing helps collapse or reorder steps to simplify the process.

## Wireframing in Practice — Real-World Scenario
**Scenario:** Room booking system — multi-step booking flow caused users to abandon the process.

**Problem discovered during wireframing:**  
- Designers wireframed the booking flow as 6 separate screens with many required fields on each step. During a lo-fi walkthrough with a user tester, users reported the flow felt long and confusing; they didn’t know how many steps remained.

**How wireframing helped resolve the issue:**  
1. **Lo-fi testing:** Team created a quick lo-fi flow with numbered steps. Tester feedback showed confusion about progress and unclear next-actions.  
2. **Design change (after wireframing):** The team reduced steps from 6 to 3, combined related fields into grouped steps, and added a persistent progress indicator at the top. They also moved the primary CTA to a more visible position in the header.  
3. **Hi-fi validation:** A hi-fi prototype in Figma showed the revised flow with realistic copy and interactions. Further testing revealed higher completion rates and fewer user errors.  
4. **Development handoff:** Wireframes and interaction notes guided developers to implement the simplified flow and modal confirmations for cancellations.

**Impact:** Reduced user drop-off during booking by simplifying steps and clarifying progress — saving development time that would have been spent reworking a poor flow.

**Conclusion:** Wireframing detected a usability problem early and allowed inexpensive fixes that improved the final product’s success.

## How to include your Figma prototype and assets
1. **Create and share a Figma prototype:** In Figma, click **Share** → set to **Anyone with link → Can view** → copy the URL.  
2. **Add the prototype link to this README:** Replace the placeholder below with your URL:
   ```
   Figma prototype: https://www.figma.com/file/your-file-id
   ```
3. **Export images/screens:** In Figma, select a frame → Export → PNG or JPG (for screenshots) or SVG (for icons).  
4. **Upload assets to repo:** Place exported files in the `figma/` or `assets/` folder and commit them. Use either the GitHub web UI or local Git.  
5. **Annotate screenshots:** For each exported frame, add a one-sentence caption describing the screen and any key interaction notes.

## Submission & Manual Review Checklist
Ensure these required items are present before you request a manual review:

- [ ] Repository named **`wireframing`** (public).
       
- [ ] `README.md` (this file) with all sections completed.
       
- [ ] Figma prototype link included and set to **viewable** by anyone with the link.
       
- [ ] `figma/` folder in repo with exported screenshots for Lo-fi and Hi-fi screens.
        
- [ ] `assets/` folder with icons and exported images (SVG or PNG).
        
- [ ] `docs/case-study.md` (optional but recommended) with a short write-up of your usability findings.
       
- [ ] Short notes/annotations next to key screenshots explaining your decisions.
       
- [ ] Commit history showing work (branches and PRs are good practice but optional).

**How to generate the review link (course platform):**  
- Follow your course/platform instructions to generate a review link. If the platform requires a GitHub repo link, paste `https://github.com/<your-username>/wireframing`. If it requests the Figma prototype, include the shared URL.
